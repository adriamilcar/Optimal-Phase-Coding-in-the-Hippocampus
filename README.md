# *Theta oscillations optimize information rate in the hippocampus*

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results in the paper *Theta oscillations optimize information rate in the hippocampus*. It is organized in notebooks that generate the figures included in the article, which in turn can be divided as follows:

- **Figure_1.ipynb**, **Figure_2.ipynb** and **Figures_3_7_8.ipynb**: Generate the figures of the **basic results** and the results included in the **Appendix**. These are intended to help understand the model and provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the main findings. 
- **Figure_4.ipynb**, **Figure_5.ipynb**, and **Figure_6.ipynb**: Generate the figures of the **main findings** in the paper, related to information rate optimization in hippocampal neurons.
